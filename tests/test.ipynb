      "✅ ETH: Buy order executed - Technical analysis across short-term (1h) and mid-term (4h) charts demonstrates a breakout attempt above the prior consolidation, with recent closes at 4,426,000 KRW and volume surging on the latest hourly candles. There was a strong push up to 4,450,000 KRW, but the price is currently retesting 4,426,000–4,430,000 after the squeeze. This is a classic 'breakout or fakeout' zone: upside momentum is visible, but not fully confirmed for a sustained run. On the news side, sentiment is mixed: Tether's $800M additional BTC purchase and Cardano's gains are bullish, but a record Bitcoin ETF outflow and Iran using crypto for weapons payments introduce risk and market uncertainty. With your sizable existing exposure (over 3.75 BTC-equivalent and over 10M KRW in cash), and in keeping with risk management and your rules (never lose money, never miss opportunity), the optimal action is to HOLD 100%. Wait for firm confirmation of a breakout above 4,450,000 with sustained volume, or a confirmed reversal, before increasing ...\n"
